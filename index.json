Our hypothesis is that these trucks do not always make optimal routing decisions which cause inefficiencies in the traffic system. Therefore, route choice of truck drivers is of interest to both transport planners and traffic management authorities. The objectives of this paper are two-fold. First, this paper models on-trip route choices of the truck drivers. Second, we assess the inefficiencies of those routing decisions. This paper utilizes Bluetooth data, loop detector data, and variable message sign data to model the route choices of truck drivers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that Bluetooth data have been used for the estimation of route choice models of truck drivers. The trucks are inferred from Bluetooth data by applying a Gaussian mixture model-based clustering technique. We apply both a binary logit model and a mixed logit model to derive the route choices of truck drivers on a case study between the port of Rotterdam and hinterland in the Netherlands. The predictive performance of the model is tested by conducting out-of-sample validation. The model results indicate truck drivers significantly value travel distance, instantaneous travel time and lane closure information en-route. The estimate of travel distance varies significantly among truck drivers. While 38 percent of truck drivers do not take the shortest time path, 48 percent of truck drivers do not choose the system-optimal path. These inefficiencies imply that traffic management solutions have the potential to improve the performance of truck-dominated motorways.","tags":null,"title":"Deriving on-trip route choices of truck drivers by utilizing Bluetooth data, loop detector data and variable message sign data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Salil Sharma","Jonas Luessmann","Jason So"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1541980800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1541980800,"objectID":"067f22fec41c9c5d652215da949a9132","permalink":"https://salilsharma.com/publication/sharma2018its/","publishdate":"2018-11-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sharma2018its/","section":"publication","summary":"Floating car data present a cost-effective approach to observing the traffic state. This paper explores whether floating cars can substitute stationary detection devices (e.g., induction loops) for observers within traffic responsive control systems. A rule-based traffic control method at the local intersection level is proposed in this paper by utilizing the floating car data. The control method involves a three-fold approach: link-level speed forecasting, data-driven traffic flow estimation, and split optimization. To estimate traffic flow, a multivariable linear regression model is developed by utilizing forecasted link-level speed, signal control variables, and link length as predictors. The method is tested using a controller (hardware)-independent software-in-the-loop approach. Compared with the existing fixed-time control operating in Starnberg, Germany, the proposed method is able to improve the level of service of the signalized intersection when tested for different levels of market penetration of the floating cars. The findings underpin the use of floating car data in online traffic control applications; the benefits will increase with an increase in market penetration of floating cars. Overall, this paper presents a fully integrated technical system that is ready to be used in the field. The proposed system can be implemented at the tactical level of urban traffic-control hierarchy employed in Germany.","tags":null,"title":"Controller Independent Software-in-the-Loop Approach to Evaluate Rule-Based Traffic Signal Retiming Strategy by Utilizing Floating Car Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Salil Sharma","Kay Axhausen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1532995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1532995200,"objectID":"967cc0faaa066343bbc6563a8b5126fa","permalink":"https://salilsharma.com/publication/sharma2009ivt/","publishdate":"2018-07-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sharma2009ivt/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, the details for the design of road infrastructure elements, including their reliability are provided. This design is based on travel time, its uncertainty, and associated generalized costs of the road user. The paper presents the methodology developed by Bernard and Axhausen (2007), which deals with this approach. It allows the construction of the design diagrams to represent annual generalized costs of the road user for relevant values of volume and traffic flow compositions. The methodology is evaluated for Swiss motorways in order to examine its applicability for the practical uses. As a result, the scope of the methodology is observed to be limited in the current formulation because of the behavior of schedule delay costs of the road user.","tags":null,"title":"Design diagrams for road infrastructure elements: High capacity roads","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I presented a paper on route choice modeling of truck drivers in the 6th International Conference on Models and Technologies for Intelligent Transportation Systems.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"3971ce50ec655c15608fa89f8e02312d","permalink":"https://salilsharma.com/post/mtits19/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/mtits19/","section":"post","summary":"I presented a paper on route choice modeling of truck drivers in the 6th International Conference on Models and Technologies for Intelligent Transportation Systems.","tags":null,"title":"Route choice modeling of truck drivers","type":"post"}]
