This paper explores whether floating cars can substitute stationary detection devices (e.g., induction loops) for observers within traffic responsive control systems. A rule-based traffic control method at the local intersection level is proposed in this paper by utilizing the floating car data. The control method involves a three-fold approach: link-level speed forecasting, data-driven traffic flow estimation, and split optimization. To estimate traffic flow, a multivariable linear regression model is developed by utilizing forecasted link-level speed, signal control variables, and link length as predictors. The method is tested using a controller (hardware)-independent software-in-the-loop approach. Compared with the existing fixed-time control operating in Starnberg, Germany, the proposed method is able to improve the level of service of the signalized intersection when tested for different levels of market penetration of the floating cars. The findings underpin the use of floating car data in online traffic control applications; the benefits will increase with an increase in market penetration of floating cars. Overall, this paper presents a fully integrated technical system that is ready to be used in the field. The proposed system can be implemented at the tactical level of urban traffic-control hierarchy employed in Germany.","tags":null,"title":"Controller Independent Software-in-the-Loop Approach to Evaluate Rule-Based Traffic Signal Retiming Strategy by Utilizing Floating Car Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Salil Sharma","Kay Axhausen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1532995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1532995200,"objectID":"967cc0faaa066343bbc6563a8b5126fa","permalink":"https://salilrsharma.github.io/publication/sharma2009ivt/","publishdate":"2018-07-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sharma2009ivt/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, the details for the design of road infrastructure elements, including their reliability are provided. This design is based on travel time, its uncertainty, and associated generalized costs of the road user. The paper presents the methodology developed by Bernard and Axhausen (2007), which deals with this approach. It allows the construction of the design diagrams to represent annual generalized costs of the road user for relevant values of volume and traffic flow compositions. The methodology is evaluated for Swiss motorways in order to examine its applicability for the practical uses. As a result, the scope of the methodology is observed to be limited in the current formulation because of the behavior of schedule delay costs of the road user.","tags":null,"title":"Design diagrams for road infrastructure elements: High capacity roads","type":"publication"}]
