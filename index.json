This paper presents an in-vehicle C-ITS application to improve traffic efficiency around a merging section. This application balances the distribution of traffic over the available lanes of a freeway, by issuing targeted lane-changing advice to a selection of vehicles. We add to existing research by embedding multiple vehicle classes in the lane-changing advisory framework. We use a multi-class multi-lane macroscopic traffic flow model to design a feedback-feedforward control law that is based on a linear quadratic regulator (LQR). The performance of the proposed system is evaluated using a microscopic traffic simulator. The results indicate that the lane-changing advisory system is able to suppress shockwaves in traffic flow and can significantly alleviate congestion. Besides bringing substantial travel time benefits around merging sections of up to nearly 21%, the system dramatically reduces the variance of travel time losses in the system.","tags":null,"title":"A Multi-Class Lane-Changing Advisory System for Freeway Merging Sections","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ali Nadi","Salil Sharma","Maaike Snelder","Taoufik Bakri","Hans Van Lint","Lóránt Tavasszy"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1618876800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618876800,"objectID":"f81855991fcfdd4aad8b844cbeb83557","permalink":"https://salilsharma.com/publication/sharma2021trc/","publishdate":"2021-04-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sharma2021trc/","section":"publication","summary":"Short-term traffic prediction is an important component of traffic management systems. Around logistics hubs such as seaports, truck flows can have a major impact on the surrounding motorways. Hence, their prediction is important to help manage traffic operations. However, The link between short-term dynamics of logistics activities and the generation of truck traffic has not yet been properly explored. This paper aims to develop a model that predicts short-term changes in truck volumes, generated from major container terminals in maritime ports. We develop, test, and demonstrate the model for the port of Rotterdam. Our input data are derived from exchanges of operational logistics messages between terminal operators, carriers and shippers, via the local Port Community System. We propose a feed-forward neural network to predict the next one hour of outbound truck traffic. To extract hidden features from the input data and select a model with appropriate features, we employ an evolutionary algorithm in accordance with the neural network model. Our model predicts outbound truck volumes with high accuracy. We formulate 2 scenarios to evaluate the forecasting abilities of the model. The model predicts lag and non-proportional responses of truck flows to changes in container turnover at terminals. The findings are relevant for traffic management agencies to help improve the efficiency and reliability of transport networks, in particular around major freight hubs.","tags":null,"title":"Short-term prediction of outbound truck traffic from the exchange of information in logistics hubs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Timo Faber","Salil Sharma","Maaike Snelder","Gerdien Klunder","Lóránt Tavasszy","Hans Van Lint"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1595376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1595376000,"objectID":"176a1442a3b83814e86045aee68be83e","permalink":"https://salilsharma.com/publication/sharma2020platoontrr/","publishdate":"2020-07-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sharma2020platoontrr/","section":"publication","summary":"Truck platooning is the application of cooperative adaptive cruise control where multiple trucks are electronically linked using vehicle-to-vehicle communication. Although truck platoons might bring fuel savings and emission reductions, their interactions with surrounding traffic and resulting impact on traffic operations and safety are not fully understood. The objective of this paper is to evaluate traffic efficiency and safety in a critical traffic situation when truck platoons are introduced in the system. This paper presents a case study of a merging section, located on A15 motorway, near the port of Rotterdam in the Netherlands. We consider two scenarios: platoons on a mainline carriageway and platoons merging onto a mainline carriageway. We simulate the movements of truck platoons in a microscopic traffic simulator. Longitudinal and lateral controllers for truck platoons, proposed in this paper, can ensure their collision-free, string-stable, and smooth driving behavior. Simulation experiments are conducted by varying platoon characteristics such as market penetration, length, intra-platoon headway, platoon speed, and their ability to create a gap for changing lanes. The results suggest that truck platoons on the mainline carriageway may be detrimental to traffic efficiency and safety in high traffic intensity, whereas truck platoons originating from an on-ramp produce limited impacts. Further, we conduct both local and global sensitivity analyses to analyze the impact of platoon characteristics on traffic efficiency and safety. The findings emphasize that uncertainty in traffic efficiency and safety strongly depends on the interactions among platoon characteristics, traffic demand, and traffic scenarios.","tags":null,"title":"Evaluating Traffic Efficiency and Safety by Varying Truck Platoon Characteristics in a Critical Traffic Situation ","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Salil Sharma","Maaike Snelder","Lóránt Tavasszy","Hans Van Lint"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1594080000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594080000,"objectID":"e3372f4d0113571e6b383ea2b1ad63a6","permalink":"https://salilsharma.com/publication/sharma2020mlctrr/","publishdate":"2020-07-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sharma2020mlctrr/","section":"publication","summary":"Lane-changing models are essential components for microscopic simulation. Although the literature recognizes that different classes of vehicles have different ways of performing lane-change maneuvers, lane change behavior of truck drivers is an overlooked research area. We propose that truck drivers are heterogeneous in their lane change behavior too and that inter-driver differences within truck drivers exist. We explore lane changing behavior of truck drivers using a trajectory data set collected around motorway bottlenecks in the Netherlands which include on-ramp, off-ramp, and weaving sections. Finite mixture models are used to categorize truck drivers with respect to their merging and diverging maneuvers. Indicator variables include spatial, temporal, kinematic, and gap acceptance characteristics of lane-changing maneuvers. The results suggest that truck drivers can be categorized into two and three categories with respect to their merging and diverging behaviors, respectively. The majority of truck drivers show a tendency to merge or diverge at the earliest possible opportunity; this type of behavior leads to most of the lane change activity at the beginning of motorway bottlenecks, thus contributing to the raised level of turbulence. By incorporating heterogeneity within the lane-changing component, the accuracy and realism of existing microscopic simulation packages can be improved for traffic and safety-related assessments.","tags":null,"title":"Categorizing Merging and Diverging Strategies of Truck Drivers at Motorway Ramps and Weaving Sections using Trajectory Dataset ","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ali Nadi","Salil Sharma","Maaike Snelder","Lóránt Tavasszy","Hans Van Lint"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1574726400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1574726400,"objectID":"8184cbf547d59a53efdcddbc73c954c7","permalink":"https://salilsharma.com/publication/sharma2019trail/","publishdate":"2019-11-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sharma2019trail/","section":"publication","summary":"In gateway seaports, like the port of Rotterdam, a substantial proportion of all freight movements is related to trips to hinterland markets. Accordingly, outbound truck flows from port areas, especially in traffic rush-hours, may degrade the level of service on truck-dominated motorways or increase the unreliability of freight transport operation. Therefore, these truck flows during traffic rush hours are of particular interest to both port and road transport authorities.Consequently, the main objective of this paper is to identify key features of port activities that induce truck traffic during rush hours by using both terminal activity data, at the container level, and truck-specific counts obtained from loop detector data for the year 2015. In this paper, we focus on inbound/outbound truck traffic. From our analysis, we find that terminals operational attributes such as estimated pick up time and container discharge time contribute mostly to the rush hour truck traffic. Besides, we identify the vessel attributes (call size), container features (size and type), and commodities which brings inefficiencies in the traffic system. Our research would be of interest to traffic managers, port of authority, and freight forwarders to invest in interventions which could improve the reliability of road freight operations.","tags":null,"title":"Analyzing the role of seaport operations in generating inbound/outbound truck traffic demand and its implications on traffic system","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Salil Sharma","Jonas Luessmann","Jason So"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1567296000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567296000,"objectID":"77690352194ae3af0f2b10ecd0fa4b06","permalink":"https://salilsharma.com/publication/sharma2019its/","publishdate":"2019-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sharma2019its/","section":"publication","summary":"Floating car data present a cost-effective approach to observing the traffic state. This paper explores whether floating cars can substitute stationary detection devices (e.g., induction loops) for observers within traffic responsive control systems. A rule-based traffic control method at the local intersection level is proposed in this paper by utilizing the floating car data. The control method involves a three-fold approach: link-level speed forecasting, data-driven traffic flow estimation, and split optimization. To estimate traffic flow, a multivariable linear regression model is developed by utilizing forecasted link-level speed, signal control variables, and link length as predictors. The method is tested using a controller (hardware)-independent software-in-the-loop approach. Compared with the existing fixed-time control operating in Starnberg, Germany, the proposed method is able to improve the level of service of the signalized intersection when tested for different levels of market penetration of the floating cars. The findings underpin the use of floating car data in online traffic control applications; the benefits will increase with an increase in market penetration of floating cars. Overall, this paper presents a fully integrated technical system that is ready to be used in the field. The proposed system can be implemented at the tactical level of urban traffic-control hierarchy employed in Germany.","tags":null,"title":"Controller Independent Software-in-the-Loop Approach to Evaluate Rule-Based Traffic Signal Retiming Strategy by Utilizing Floating Car Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Satish Ukkusuri","Fasil Sagir","Nishtha Mahajan","Benjamin Bowman","Salil Sharma"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1564617600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564617600,"objectID":"f26b60e252b26493419ce6f649597193","permalink":"https://salilsharma.com/publication/sharma2019indot/","publishdate":"2019-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sharma2019indot/","section":"publication","summary":"Autonomous vehicle (AV) and Connected vehicle (CV) technologies are rapidly maturing and the timeline for their wider deployment is currently uncertain. These technologies are expected to have a number of significant societal benefits: traffic safety, improved mobility, improved road efficiency, reduced cost of congestion, reduced energy use, and reduced fuel emissions. State and local transportation agencies need to understand what this means for them and what they need to do now and in the next few years to prepare for the AV/CV future. In this context, the objectives of this research are as follows: (1). Synthesize the existing state of practice and how other state agencies are addressing the pending transition to AV/CV environment, (2). Estimate the impacts of AV/CV environment within the context of (a) traffic operations—impact of headway distribution and traffic signal coordination; (b) traffic control devices; (c) roadway safety in terms of intersection crashes, and (3) Provide a strategic roadmap for INDOT in preparing for and responding to potential issues. This research is divided into two parts. The first part is a synthesis study of existing state of practice in the AV/CV context by conducting an extensive literature review and interviews with other transportation agencies. Based on this, we develop a roadmap for INDOT and similar agencies clearly delineating how they should invest in AV/CV technologies in the short, medium, and long term.

Our hypothesis is that these trucks do not always make optimal routing decisions which cause inefficiencies in the traffic system. Therefore, route choice of truck drivers is of interest to both transport planners and traffic management authorities. The objectives of this paper are two-fold. First, this paper models on-trip route choices of the truck drivers. Second, we assess the inefficiencies of those routing decisions. This paper utilizes Bluetooth data, loop detector data, and variable message sign data to model the route choices of truck drivers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that Bluetooth data have been used for the estimation of route choice models of truck drivers. The trucks are inferred from Bluetooth data by applying a Gaussian mixture model-based clustering technique. We apply both a binary logit model and a mixed logit model to derive the route choices of truck drivers on a case study between the port of Rotterdam and hinterland in the Netherlands. The predictive performance of the model is tested by conducting out-of-sample validation. The model results indicate truck drivers significantly value travel distance, instantaneous travel time and lane closure information en-route. The estimate of travel distance varies significantly among truck drivers. While 38 percent of truck drivers do not take the shortest time path, 48 percent of truck drivers do not choose the system-optimal path. These inefficiencies imply that traffic management solutions have the potential to improve the performance of truck-dominated motorways.","tags":null,"title":"Deriving on-trip route choices of truck drivers by utilizing Bluetooth data, loop detector data and variable message sign data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Salil Sharma","Kay Axhausen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1532995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1532995200,"objectID":"967cc0faaa066343bbc6563a8b5126fa","permalink":"https://salilsharma.com/publication/sharma2009ivt/","publishdate":"2018-07-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sharma2009ivt/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, the details for the design of road infrastructure elements, including their reliability are provided.
